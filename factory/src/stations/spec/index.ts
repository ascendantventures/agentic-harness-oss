## Step ${stepOffset} — Read the GitHub issue

\`\`\`bash
gh issue view ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo}
\`\`\`

The issue body contains the client intake manifest with project signals, selected skills, and tech stack. Use it alongside any attached documents.

## Step ${stepOffset + 1} — Read known build patterns before writing spec

If a build-patterns.md file exists in your workspace, read it now.

Apply these patterns proactively in the spec you are about to write:
- Define ALL DB column names in a naming conventions table — be consistent (hoa_id everywhere, not hoa_id in some places and community_id in others)
- Flag every table that has an auth trigger with a note: BUILD must use upsert() not insert()
- Define ALL Supabase Storage bucket names in one place in the spec — BUILD will create lib/storage.ts constants
- For every API route, list ALL roles that have access (not just "admin") — prevent role check drift
- Mark every external service (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) in Prerequisites as ⚠️ Needs setup — QA will skip gracefully

## Step ${stepOffset + 2} — Write the spec to /tmp/spec-issue-${issue.number}.md

Write a complete, BUILD-actionable technical specification including:
- **Project summary** — what is being built and why
- **Architecture decisions** — stack choices, hosting, key constraints
- **Database schema** — a dedicated \`## Migration SQL\` section with complete, runnable Postgres SQL: CREATE TABLE statements with all columns, indexes, triggers (always SECURITY DEFINER), and RLS policies. BUILD will run this directly via \`supabase db push\`. SPEC owns tables+triggers+indexes. BUILD owns RLS. Always apply PATTERN 2 (upsert triggers) and PATTERN 11 (SECURITY DEFINER) from build-patterns.md.
  - ⚠️ **Table isolation:** ALL tables MUST be prefixed with the project slug (e.g. issue "Todo App" → \`todo_items\`, NOT \`todos\`). NEVER create unprefixed tables like \`profiles\`, \`users\`, \`tasks\` — these collide with shared projects.
  - ⚠️ **NEVER replace \`auth.*\` triggers** (e.g. \`handle_new_user\`) that may already exist. Use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING and prefixed tables instead.
- **API routes** — Next.js App Router endpoints with request/response shapes
- **Key React components** — component tree and responsibilities
- **Requirements** in REQ-/AC- format:
  - \`REQ-[PREFIX]-NNN: Title\`
  - User story: "As a [role], I want [action] so that [value]"
  - Acceptance Criteria: \`AC-NNN.1: When X, shall Y\` — testable, specific, verifiable
- **Pre-written Playwright E2E test specs** — actual test code for critical workflows
- **## Prerequisites** — THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY. List every dependency that must be in place BEFORE QA can run:
  - Every required environment variable (name, where to get it, whether it's available or needs client input)
  - Every external service/API the app calls (Stripe, Twilio, Sport80, etc.) — is it configured? Does it need a key from the client?
  - Every open question that MUST be answered before BUILD starts — do NOT leave ambiguous requirements for BUILD to guess
  - Mark each item as: ✅ Ready | ⚠️ Needs setup | ❌ Blocked (needs client input)
  - If any item is ❌ Blocked — the spec should NOT be approved until it's resolved
  Format:
  \`\`\`
  ## Prerequisites
  | Dependency | Status | Notes |
  |---|---|---|
  | NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL | ✅ Ready | Auto-configured |
  | STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | ⚠️ Needs setup | Client must create Stripe account |
  | SPORT80_API_TOKEN | ❌ Blocked | Waiting on client to provide |
  \`\`\`
- **## Phase Scope** — THIS SECTION IS MANDATORY. The factory ships Phase 1 immediately. Phase 2+ are follow-up issues. This prevents BUILD from getting blocked on complex integrations.
  - **Phase 1 (BUILD NOW):** Core product features — auth, CRUD, main UI flows, basic integrations already configured. Everything BUILD can ship without external blockers.
  - **Phase 2 (DEFERRED):** External service integrations (Stripe, Twilio, DocuSign, OAuth providers), compliance-sensitive modules (IOLTA, legal/financial reporting), white-label/custom domain infrastructure, anything marked ❌ Blocked in Prerequisites.
  - **Rule:** If a feature requires a client-provided API key, a third-party account, compliance review, or significant infrastructure setup → Phase 2. Ship it later as a new issue.
  - **Rule:** Phase 1 must be a complete, usable product on its own — not a skeleton waiting for Phase 2.
  Format:
  \`\`\`
  ## Phase Scope
  ### ✅ Phase 1 — Build Now
  | Feature | Notes |
  |---|---|
  | Core CRUD + auth | All tables, RLS, login/signup |
  | Main UI flows | Dashboard, list views, detail pages, forms |
  | ... | |

  ### ❌ Phase 2 — Deferred
  | Feature | Reason |
  |---|---|
  | Stripe billing | Needs client Stripe account + webhook setup |
  | Email notifications | Needs Resend domain verification |
  | ... | |
  \`\`\`
- **Open questions** — genuine blockers that must be resolved before BUILD starts
- **Size estimate** — S / M / L / XL with reasoning
- **Selected skills and install commands** from the manifest

## Step ${stepOffset + 3} — Post spec + update state

\`\`\`bash
# Post spec as GitHub comment
gh issue comment ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --body "$(cat /tmp/spec-issue-${issue.number}.md)"

# Flip station label
gh issue edit ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} \\
  --remove-label "station:intake" --add-label "station:spec"

# Tag complexity based on spec (create labels if needed, then apply)
# Rules:
#   complexity:simple  — <5 REQs, no payments, no real-time, no multi-role auth
#   complexity:medium  — 5-9 REQs, OR has auth/bookings but no payments/AI
#   complexity:complex — 10+ REQs, OR has payments/AI/multi-role/integrations
#
# Count your REQs, check for payment_required/auth_required in manifest, then run ONE of:
gh label create "complexity:simple"  --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --color "0075ca" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "complexity:medium"  --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --color "e4e669" 2>/dev/null || true
gh label create "complexity:complex" --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --color "d73a4a" 2>/dev/null || true
# Then add the appropriate label — pick EXACTLY ONE:
# gh issue edit ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --add-label "complexity:simple"
# gh issue edit ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --add-label "complexity:medium"
# gh issue edit ${issue.number} --repo ${ctx.env.repo} --add-label "complexity:complex"

# Update Supabase station
curl -s -X PATCH \\
  "${SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/submissions?github_issue_url=ilike.*%2Fissues%2F${issue.number}" \\
  -H "apikey: ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY}" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY}" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"station": "spec"}'
\`\`\`

Do NOT set spec_approved — the owner must review and approve before BUILD starts.

# Push spec_ready card to client thread so approval button appears in chat
SUBMISSION_ID=$(curl -s \\
  "${SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1/submissions?github_issue_url=ilike.*%2Fissues%2F${issue.number}&select=id" \\
  -H "apikey: ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY}" \\
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY}" | python3 -c "import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d[0]['id'] if d else '')" 2>/dev/null)

if [ -n "$SUBMISSION_ID" ]; then
  # Use jq to safely build JSON — shell interpolation breaks on special chars in spec content
  SPEC_SUMMARY=$(head -5 /tmp/spec-issue-${issue.number}.md 2>/dev/null | tr '\\n' ' ')
  # Extract Phase 1 features: lines under "## Phase 1" heading that start with a bullet/dash
  PHASE1_FEATURES=$(python3 -c "
import sys, json
lines = open('/tmp/spec-issue-${issue.number}.md').readlines() if __import__('os').path.exists('/tmp/spec-issue-${issue.number}.md') else []
in_phase1 = False
features = []
for line in lines:
    l = line.strip()
    if l.lower().startswith('## phase 1') or l.lower().startswith('# phase 1'):
        in_phase1 = True
        continue
    if in_phase1 and l.startswith('##'):
        break
    if in_phase1 and (l.startswith('- ') or l.startswith('* ')):
        features.append(l.lstrip('-* ').strip())
print(json.dumps(features))
" 2>/dev/null || echo '[]')
  PUSH_PAYLOAD=$(jq -n \\
    --arg summary "$SPEC_SUMMARY" \\
    --arg sid "$SUBMISSION_ID" \\
    --argjson features "$PHASE1_FEATURES" \\
    '{
      type: "spec_card",
      content: "Your spec is ready — review and approve to start building.",
      payload: {
        type: "spec_card",
        station: "spec",
        specSummary: $summary,
        phase1Features: $features,
        phase2Features: [],
        prerequisites: [],
        submissionId: $sid,
        sizeEstimate: "S"
      }
    }')
  curl -s -X POST "${ctx.env.factoryAppUrl}/api/threads/$SUBMISSION_ID/push" \\
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
    -H "x-factory-secret: ${ctx.env.factorySecret}" \\
    -d "$PUSH_PAYLOAD"
  echo "✓ Pushed spec_ready card to thread $SUBMISSION_ID"
fi

## Step ${stepOffset + 4} — Create Phase 2 tracking issue (if Phase 2 has any features)

If your spec has a "Phase 2 — Deferred" section with at least one feature, create a tracking issue NOW so deferred work is never lost:

\`\`\`bash
# Extract Phase 2 features from your spec and create a tracking issue
gh issue create --repo ${ctx.env.repo} \\
  --title "[Phase 2] #${issue.number} — <Project Name> — Deferred Features" \\
  --body "## Phase 2 Tracking — linked to #${issue.number}

Phase 1 is live. These features were deferred and should be built as a follow-up once Phase 1 is approved.

### Deferred Features
<!-- Paste the Phase 2 table from the spec here -->

### To kick off Phase 2
1. Client approves Phase 1 delivery
2. Add label \`station:intake\` to this issue  
3. Factory will auto-queue SPEC → DESIGN → BUILD

### Prerequisites for Phase 2
<!-- List any client accounts, API keys, or config needed before Phase 2 can start -->" \\
  --label "station:spec,type:phase2"
\`\`\`

Only create the Phase 2 issue if there are actual deferred features. Skip this step if everything fit in Phase 1.`,
    };
  }
}
